### Pre-requisities 
* You need to have ***GCC*** installed from [here](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/).

### How to Run
* Go to the root folder and execute the command : ```make -B```.
* This will run all the tests inside [list.c](list.c) and will indicate if ```all tests are passed```.

### Testing
* There are 10 tests inside [list.c](list.c) that test each aspect of Inserting, Getting and Deleting nodes in both cases where the node before/after is being affected.
* Once you run the application all tests should be automatically run and it should indicate that all tests have passed.
